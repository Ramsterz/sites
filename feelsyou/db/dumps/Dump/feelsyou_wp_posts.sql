Even better, the show story was later made into a movie starring Will Farrell and Nicole Kidman.

In 1999, the fence was brought down and the front windows were replaced by bay windows in the “Bewitched” time. The front door was different in a little way. While facing the Partridge house, the next door home to the right was used in the “I Dream of Jeannie” as Jeannie and Major Nelson’s house. This home’s front yard was removed during “The Partridge Family”. Three feet of the yard were removed to widen the driveway so as to accommodate the bus.

The show might have lasted for only 8 seasons but the twitchy nose signature by Samantha remains an indelible mark in everyone’s memory. Even better, the show story was later made into a movie starring Will Farrell and Nicole Kidman. Since the NBC pilot order in October 2014, there has been a rumor on the TV show remake.</h3>\r\n<h3>There were stringent moves and efforts to conceal a number of issues regarding the TV show. However, there are a couple of things that could never be kept a secret, not forever. Below are 20 things you probably never knew about the “Bewitched” TV show.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The Revelation of Sol Saks’ Inspiration</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The “Bewitched” show’s creator, Sol Saks, created the show after watched the <em>I Married A Witch </em>and <em>Bell, Book and Candle </em>films. He modeled the pilot episode after these films. In a number of interviews, Saks expressed his confidence in lack of contradiction and no litigation since the “Bewitched” show was produced by Screen Gems, a company owned by Columbia Pictures and so were both movies.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>“The Darrin Syndrome”</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Several actors played Darrin, Samantha’s husband. For instance, the switching of Dick York with Dick Sargent was a shocking move by the directors. It was done without warning or notice whatsoever. This was presumably done with the guts that the audience would never care or notice. It was later known as “The Darrin Syndrome.” For information, Dick York hard chronic back pain and thus left the show.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Other characters too were swapped</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>For most people, Darrin was the most, if not the only, switched character in the show. This is without the knowledge of many on the fact that actresses too were swapped for the Gladys Kravitz’s nosey neighbor role. This part was first played by Alice Pearce and later taken by Sandra Gould.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Richard Crenna was almost a Darrin</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>As the pilot was searching for Samantha, Richard Sargent was close to signing for the role of Darrin Stephens. He was a young actor in those early days of the show casting. Crenna could have not been a serious consideration but who knows what could have happened to the show if he was chosen! Probably, the Darrin Syndrome would never have occurred.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Elizabeth Montgomery played multiple roles and never replaced</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>While other characters were being switched, Montgomery never got replaced and in fact, she played as Serena – Samantha’s cousin.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Then came Dick Sargent</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>During the 5<sup>th</sup> season of “Bewitched,” York was given some B-12 by a replacement doctor. It was during a lunch break after filming. He got a seizure and was rushed to the hospital. The show continued without Darrin since he never returned. This happened for a few episodes until the new Dick Sargent came in.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Then Came York</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Later, Richard Crenna got an offer to play the next Darrin, but again he was too busy and tied up with “The Real McCoys”, and so he missed out – again! The male lead role went to Dick York. Later, the role was taken up by Sargent. It is a question of speculation on whether or not the show would have lasted 8 seasons if he took the role.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Why did Dick York leave?</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>While there was no explanation on the show as to why York departed, the actor had a good reason for his departure. While he was filming <em>Cordura, </em>York tore most of his right back muscles and they never recovered fully. He got pain medication but it was never a long-term solution.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Pregnancies for Montgomery</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Elizabeth was pregnant for 3 times. She had her firstborn in July 1964. Two of her pregnancies were brought into the script by the producers. This saw the introduction of Adam and Tabitha to the Stephens family. Indeed, this enriched the TV family in a very natural way.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The new Darrin Stephens – Dick York</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Samantha Stephens had a mortal husband, Darrin Stephens. Dick York played his role. Throughout the 60s, he was a beloved actor thanks to this role. In addition, his <em>Inherit the Wind </em>classic film in the 60s gave him a name. He would later carry his charm and looks into his future life.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Anti-Aging Potion</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>In her 60s, Elizabeth was truly a cool babe. She maintained her beauty even in her later years. Her secret must have been some anti-aging spell on herself.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Special Brooch</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>In case you never knew, Agnes Moorehead wore a starburst brooch often. It was set with old-mine diamonds of 8.5 carats. The pin was admired by many including Montgomery. When Moorehead’s TV daughter passed on in 1974, she bequeathed it to her.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Terminal Cancer for Alice Pearce</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Alice Pearce passed away in March 1966; marking has disappearance from the “Bewitched” world. Four months before Alice landed her new role in the show, she got the cancer diagnosis. Unfortunately, even after the surgery, doctors informed her that her ovarian cancer was terminal. She kept this to herself and never told her coworkers about it.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The Emmy Award</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Two months after Alice died, her contribution through her Gladys’ portrayal, she received the Emmy Award for the Outstanding Supporting Actress.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Friends behind the Camera? Moorehead and York had bloomed one!</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Unlike their uneasy relationship on the show, Darrin and Endora – played by York and Moorehead respectively – were great friends off the camera. It is even understood that Moorehead was close to York than anyone else in the cast.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>How about their Costumes?</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>According to Kasey Rogers, who played as Louise Tate, supporting actors had their own wardrobes. They would bring their own clothes a week prior to filming. They would then be cleaned and pressed by the wardrobe department.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Cold Shoulder</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>When Dick Sargent came in to replace Dick York as Darrin Stephens in the show, Moorehead did not like. She used to admire York’s talent on the screen. In fact, in a number of episodes, there was no Darrin at all.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Aunt Clara Collected</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>It might appear as a wonder how Aunt Clara was obsessed with door knobs… but did you know that it was based on Marion Lorne’s real-life obsession? You will be shocked to know that the actress had over 1,000 antique door openers she had collected.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Samantha’s Magic</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Stagehands had to do an extra thing to deliver Samantha’s “magic.” In the 60s, there was no CGI that existed. For instance, the director would have to yell ‘Cut!’ as Montgomery stood with her arms up whenever Samantha need to tidy the living room up quickly. This would be an opportunity for the stagehand to remove the clutter. Crutch-like devices were used to help her keep her arms up for some time.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>and that Auntie…</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Aunt Clara was known for her endearing to the Stephens, even with all this strangeness. Darrin despised her, just like most of the relatives to Samantha.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Always Together</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>As a passenger on Pan Am Flight 103, Jonathan had a tragic accident: it exploded over the Scotland back in 1988. Two years later, David died from heart attack and both were buried together at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Black High School students at it!</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The Christmas Episode on the “Sisters at Heart” was created by black students. It was created by 22 African-American 10<sup>th</sup> graders during an English class in Marcella Saunders. The episode had a great story but has recently been considered to be politically wrong – this is due to a number of actors appearing in blackface at some point.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Anti-Racism</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>When Samantha casts a spell on a Darrin’s racist client, the plot is then coined. The client saw everyone, including himself, as having a black skin.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Fate and Tragic Naming of Larry Tate’s Son</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>During the show, Larry and Louise Tate had a baby boy. David White requested that the kid be named as Jonathan. This was inspired by the actor’s real life son, Jonathan, whom he had raised as a single father after his wife’s death. She had died due to second pregnancy complications.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>…and Action!</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>She would lower the arms and continue with the scene once the director yelled, “Action!”</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The Theme Song</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Many never knew this but the theme song for Bewitched had lyrics. They were, however, never sung over opening credits.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The wrong Obituary of Elizabeth Montgomery</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Montgomery never allowed too much of her private life into the public space. She was very privy with such information. Her age was published as 57 at the time of her death. What many do not know is that Elizabeth was 62 by then.</h3>\r\n<h3>A number of obituaries too listed Montgomery as single. This was wrong information since she never revealed the information to the public about her marriage to Robert Foxworth a few years earlier.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The perspective of Darrin</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The lyrics to a song from YouTube that Steve Lawrence was heard sing were written in Darrin’s perspective – if he only knew that his wife too was a witch.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Inconsistencies in her Birth Certificate</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>There was a major inconsistency in her middle name. According to the birth certificate, her middle name was Victoria but the death certificate listed her as “Elizabeth A. Montgomery.” This was one of the least known birth certificate inconsistencies.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Drunk on set</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>In a number of cases, cast members were drunk and some were even filmed drunk. It went beyond the players to even the producers, such as William Asher. Various fan sites were born to log the number of times any episode a given character was noted to be drunk. The habit was truly pervasive.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>You won’t believe the Drinking Habits</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>There are various nightclubs and bars mentioned in the Bewitched show. To show that the habit was slowly getting out of hand, here is a list of those bars: Purple Popsicle night club, The Diamond Slipper, Joe’s Bar and Grill, Happy Times Bar, Dundee’s Bar (that was referred to as “the best restaurant in town” by Darrin), Golden Spoon Restaurant, Hearthstone Bar/Restaurant, and Elbow Room Cocktail Lounge.</h3>\r\n<h3>When children were on set, the rules were supposedly stricter. To imitate the alcohol looks, actors would be advised to use iced tea. For instance, Dick Wilson often played a drunk in Bewitched. He can only be assumed to know the intense acting involved! The habit was truly record-breaking in the show.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Montgomery almost missed in the Show</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Tammy Grimes was Sol Saks’ favorite actress to take the lead witch role. Initially, the character was to be called Cassandra and not Samantha. Saks liked the fact that Grimes had an elfin appearance that was natural. Bill Asher and Sol Saks settled for Elizabeth for the series. From the original plans, she was not to make the cut.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>…indeed Cassandra was never to be</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>She auditioned for the original role but her contract with Screen Gems tied her down and could never take the job. This necessitated for the character to be renamed to Samantha.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The magic is here</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>For the “Bewitched” set, the house that was used for the “Gidget,” 1959 movie was copied in reverse and used. The interior and patio were a replica of another Gidget movie. The home’s façade too had appeared in “I Dream of Jeannie” and “Dennis the Menace” shows among others.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>No Personal Differences</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Both the “I Dream Of Jeannie” and “Bewitched” shows were based on gorgeous blonde women who had magical powers.  From the shows, Jeannie was a 2,000-year-old genie who fell in love with a NASA astronaut and both had a shared plot line then. However, Elizabeth never felt any personal issue with “I Dream Of Jeannie’s” Larry Hagman and Barbara Eden – who were the stars.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Two Tabithas</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Originally, the Olsen twins, who were fraternal, were named Diane and Erin Murphy. They were cast to share Tabitha, Stephens’s daughter role.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Be Natural</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>When Erin took to acting, she quickly became a star of the show. She was used for close-up shots as well as speaking scenes. On the other hand, Diane was used for long shots.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Witches at War</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Rumor has it that the debut of NBC’s “I Dream Of Jeannie” show a year after “Bewitched” on ABC never pleased Elizabeth Montgomery. Seems the rivalry in the networks went down to the shows and actors!</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Gladys Kravitz’s Hand-Me-Down</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The lot and its neighborhood of homes has been in use for close to half a decade. It can be recognized from a number of TV films and shows. Actually, this was often at the same time! The homes were officially known as “Blondie Street” after the movie serial that was based on adventures of Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead.)</h3>\r\n<h3>During “Bewithced”, the nosy neighbor to Samantha and Darrin, Mrs Kravitz was also living in the Patridge home.

The show might have lasted for only 8 seasons but the twitchy nose signature by Samantha remains an indelible mark in everyone’s memory. Even better, the show story was later made into a movie starring Will Farrell and Nicole Kidman. Since the NBC pilot order in October 2014, there has been a rumor on the TV show remake.</h3>\r\n<h3>There were stringent moves and efforts to conceal a number of issues regarding the TV show. However, there are a couple of things that could never be kept a secret, not forever. Below are 20 things you probably never knew about the “Bewitched” TV show.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The Revelation of Sol Saks’ Inspiration</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The “Bewitched” show’s creator, Sol Saks, created the show after watched the <em>I Married A Witch </em>and <em>Bell, Book and Candle </em>films. He modeled the pilot episode after these films. In a number of interviews, Saks expressed his confidence in lack of contradiction and no litigation since the “Bewitched” show was produced by Screen Gems, a company owned by Columbia Pictures and so were both movies.</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>“The Darrin Syndrome”</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Several actors played Darrin, Samantha’s husband. For instance, the switching of Dick York with Dick Sargent was a shocking move by the directors. It was done without warning or notice whatsoever. This was presumably done with the guts that the audience would never care or notice. It was later known as “The Darrin Syndrome.” For information, Dick York hard chronic back pain and thus left the show.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Other characters too were swapped</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>For most people, Darrin was the most, if not the only, switched character in the show. This is without the knowledge of many on the fact that actresses too were swapped for the Gladys Kravitz’s nosey neighbor role. This part was first played by Alice Pearce and later taken by Sandra Gould.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Richard Crenna was almost a Darrin</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>As the pilot was searching for Samantha, Richard Sargent was close to signing for the role of Darrin Stephens. He was a young actor in those early days of the show casting. Crenna could have not been a serious consideration but who knows what could have happened to the show if he was chosen! Probably, the Darrin Syndrome would never have occurred.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Elizabeth Montgomery played multiple roles and never replaced</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>While other characters were being switched, Montgomery never got replaced and in fact, she played as Serena – Samantha’s cousin.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Then came Dick Sargent</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>During the 5<sup>th</sup> season of “Bewitched,” York was given some B-12 by a replacement doctor. It was during a lunch break after filming. He got a seizure and was rushed to the hospital. The show continued without Darrin since he never returned. This happened for a few episodes until the new Dick Sargent came in.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Then Came York</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Later, Richard Crenna got an offer to play the next Darrin, but again he was too busy and tied up with “The Real McCoys”, and so he missed out – again! The male lead role went to Dick York. Later, the role was taken up by Sargent. It is a question of speculation on whether or not the show would have lasted 8 seasons if he took the role.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Why did Dick York leave?</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>While there was no explanation on the show as to why York departed, the actor had a good reason for his departure. While he was filming <em>Cordura, </em>York tore most of his right back muscles and they never recovered fully. He got pain medication but it was never a long-term solution.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Pregnancies for Montgomery</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Elizabeth was pregnant for 3 times. She had her firstborn in July 1964. Two of her pregnancies were brought into the script by the producers. This saw the introduction of Adam and Tabitha to the Stephens family. Indeed, this enriched the TV family in a very natural way.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The new Darrin Stephens – Dick York</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Samantha Stephens had a mortal husband, Darrin Stephens. Dick York played his role. Throughout the 60s, he was a beloved actor thanks to this role. In addition, his <em>Inherit the Wind </em>classic film in the 60s gave him a name. He would later carry his charm and looks into his future life.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Anti-Aging Potion</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>In her 60s, Elizabeth was truly a cool babe. She maintained her beauty even in her later years. Her secret must have been some anti-aging spell on herself.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Special Brooch</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>In case you never knew, Agnes Moorehead wore a starburst brooch often. It was set with old-mine diamonds of 8.5 carats. The pin was admired by many including Montgomery. When Moorehead’s TV daughter passed on in 1974, she bequeathed it to her.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Terminal Cancer for Alice Pearce</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Alice Pearce passed away in March 1966; marking has disappearance from the “Bewitched” world. Four months before Alice landed her new role in the show, she got the cancer diagnosis. Unfortunately, even after the surgery, doctors informed her that her ovarian cancer was terminal. She kept this to herself and never told her coworkers about it.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The Emmy Award</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Two months after Alice died, her contribution through her Gladys’ portrayal, she received the Emmy Award for the Outstanding Supporting Actress.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Friends behind the Camera? Moorehead and York had bloomed one!</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Unlike their uneasy relationship on the show, Darrin and Endora – played by York and Moorehead respectively – were great friends off the camera. It is even understood that Moorehead was close to York than anyone else in the cast.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>How about their Costumes?</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>According to Kasey Rogers, who played as Louise Tate, supporting actors had their own wardrobes. They would bring their own clothes a week prior to filming. They would then be cleaned and pressed by the wardrobe department.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Cold Shoulder</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>When Dick Sargent came in to replace Dick York as Darrin Stephens in the show, Moorehead did not like. She used to admire York’s talent on the screen. In fact, in a number of episodes, there was no Darrin at all.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Aunt Clara Collected</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>It might appear as a wonder how Aunt Clara was obsessed with door knobs… but did you know that it was based on Marion Lorne’s real-life obsession? You will be shocked to know that the actress had over 1,000 antique door openers she had collected.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Samantha’s Magic</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Stagehands had to do an extra thing to deliver Samantha’s “magic.” In the 60s, there was no CGI that existed. For instance, the director would have to yell ‘Cut!’ as Montgomery stood with her arms up whenever Samantha need to tidy the living room up quickly. This would be an opportunity for the stagehand to remove the clutter. Crutch-like devices were used to help her keep her arms up for some time.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>and that Auntie…</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Aunt Clara was known for her endearing to the Stephens, even with all this strangeness. Darrin despised her, just like most of the relatives to Samantha.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Always Together</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>As a passenger on Pan Am Flight 103, Jonathan had a tragic accident: it exploded over the Scotland back in 1988. Two years later, David died from heart attack and both were buried together at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Black High School students at it!</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The Christmas Episode on the “Sisters at Heart” was created by black students. It was created by 22 African-American 10<sup>th</sup> graders during an English class in Marcella Saunders. The episode had a great story but has recently been considered to be politically wrong – this is due to a number of actors appearing in blackface at some point.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Anti-Racism</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>When Samantha casts a spell on a Darrin’s racist client, the plot is then coined. The client saw everyone, including himself, as having a black skin.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Fate and Tragic Naming of Larry Tate’s Son</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>During the show, Larry and Louise Tate had a baby boy. David White requested that the kid be named as Jonathan. This was inspired by the actor’s real life son, Jonathan, whom he had raised as a single father after his wife’s death. She had died due to second pregnancy complications.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>…and Action!</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>She would lower the arms and continue with the scene once the director yelled, “Action!”</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The Theme Song</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Many never knew this but the theme song for Bewitched had lyrics. They were, however, never sung over opening credits.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The wrong Obituary of Elizabeth Montgomery</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Montgomery never allowed too much of her private life into the public space. She was very privy with such information. Her age was published as 57 at the time of her death. What many do not know is that Elizabeth was 62 by then.</h3>\r\n<h3>A number of obituaries too listed Montgomery as single. This was wrong information since she never revealed the information to the public about her marriage to Robert Foxworth a few years earlier.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The perspective of Darrin</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The lyrics to a song from YouTube that Steve Lawrence was heard sing were written in Darrin’s perspective – if he only knew that his wife too was a witch.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Inconsistencies in her Birth Certificate</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>There was a major inconsistency in her middle name. According to the birth certificate, her middle name was Victoria but the death certificate listed her as “Elizabeth A. Montgomery.” This was one of the least known birth certificate inconsistencies.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Drunk on set</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>In a number of cases, cast members were drunk and some were even filmed drunk. It went beyond the players to even the producers, such as William Asher. Various fan sites were born to log the number of times any episode a given character was noted to be drunk. The habit was truly pervasive.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>You won’t believe the Drinking Habits</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>There are various nightclubs and bars mentioned in the Bewitched show. To show that the habit was slowly getting out of hand, here is a list of those bars: Purple Popsicle night club, The Diamond Slipper, Joe’s Bar and Grill, Happy Times Bar, Dundee’s Bar (that was referred to as “the best restaurant in town” by Darrin), Golden Spoon Restaurant, Hearthstone Bar/Restaurant, and Elbow Room Cocktail Lounge.</h3>\r\n<h3>When children were on set, the rules were supposedly stricter. To imitate the alcohol looks, actors would be advised to use iced tea. For instance, Dick Wilson often played a drunk in Bewitched. He can only be assumed to know the intense acting involved! The habit was truly record-breaking in the show.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Montgomery almost missed in the Show</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Tammy Grimes was Sol Saks’ favorite actress to take the lead witch role. Initially, the character was to be called Cassandra and not Samantha. Saks liked the fact that Grimes had an elfin appearance that was natural. Bill Asher and Sol Saks settled for Elizabeth for the series. From the original plans, she was not to make the cut.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>…indeed Cassandra was never to be</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>She auditioned for the original role but her contract with Screen Gems tied her down and could never take the job. This necessitated for the character to be renamed to Samantha.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The magic is here</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>For the “Bewitched” set, the house that was used for the “Gidget,” 1959 movie was copied in reverse and used. The interior and patio were a replica of another Gidget movie. The home’s façade too had appeared in “I Dream of Jeannie” and “Dennis the Menace” shows among others.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>No Personal Differences</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Both the “I Dream Of Jeannie” and “Bewitched” shows were based on gorgeous blonde women who had magical powers.  From the shows, Jeannie was a 2,000-year-old genie who fell in love with a NASA astronaut and both had a shared plot line then. However, Elizabeth never felt any personal issue with “I Dream Of Jeannie’s” Larry Hagman and Barbara Eden – who were the stars.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Two Tabithas</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Originally, the Olsen twins, who were fraternal, were named Diane and Erin Murphy. They were cast to share Tabitha, Stephens’s daughter role.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Be Natural</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>When Erin took to acting, she quickly became a star of the show. She was used for close-up shots as well as speaking scenes. On the other hand, Diane was used for long shots.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Witches at War</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Rumor has it that the debut of NBC’s “I Dream Of Jeannie” show a year after “Bewitched” on ABC never pleased Elizabeth Montgomery. Seems the rivalry in the networks went down to the shows and actors!</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>Gladys Kravitz’s Hand-Me-Down</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The lot and its neighborhood of homes has been in use for close to half a decade. It can be recognized from a number of TV films and shows. Actually, this was often at the same time! The homes were officially known as “Blondie Street” after the movie serial that was based on adventures of Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead.)</h3>\r\n<h3>During “Bewithced”, the nosy neighbor to Samantha and Darrin, Mrs Kravitz was also living in the Patridge home. The show, “The Partridge Family” debuted before the “Bewitched” series ended its run. This shows that both the Kravitz and the Partridge shared a home.</h3>\r\n<h3>Living in a modern 2-story house that had a white picket fence, the Partridge family was so modern. In 1999, the fence was brought down and the front windows were replaced by bay windows in the “Bewitched” time. The front door was different in a little way. While facing the Partridge house, the next door home to the right was used in the “I Dream of Jeannie” as Jeannie and Major Nelson’s house. This home’s front yard was removed during “The Partridge Family”. Three feet of the yard were removed to widen the driveway so as to accommodate the bus.

remains a shock how “Bewitched” has remained in the limelight since it first aired back on September 17, 1964. The show might have lasted for only 8 seasons but the twitchy nose signature by Samantha remains an indelible mark in everyone’s memory. Even better, the show story was later made into a movie starring Will Farrell and Nicole Kidman. Since the NBC pilot order in October 2014, there has been a rumor on the TV show remake.</h3>\r\n<h3>There were stringent moves and efforts to conceal a number of issues regarding the TV show. However, there are a couple of things that could never be kept a secret, not forever. Below are 20 things you probably never knew about the “Bewitched” TV show.</h3>\r\n<h2><strong>The Revelation of Sol Saks’ Inspiration</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>The “Bewitched” show’s creator, Sol Saks, created the show after watched the <em>I Married A Witch </em>and <em>Bell, Book and Candle </em>films. He modeled the pilot episode after these films. In a number of interviews, Saks expressed his confidence in lack of contradiction and no litigation since the “Bewitched” show was produced by Screen Gems, a company owned by Columbia Pictures and so were both movies.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-972 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Bewitched-Creator-1024x527.png\" alt=\"bewitched-creator\" width=\"632\" height=\"325\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>“The Darrin Syndrome”</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Several actors played Darrin, Samantha’s husband. For instance, the switching of Dick York with Dick Sargent was a shocking move by the directors. It was done without warning or notice whatsoever. This was presumably done with the guts that the audience would never care or notice. It was later known as “The Darrin Syndrome.” For information, Dick York hard chronic back pain and thus left the show.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-973 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/The-Darrin-1024x517.jpg\" alt=\"the-darrin\" width=\"640\" height=\"323\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Other characters too were swapped</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>For most people, Darrin was the most, if not the only, switched character in the show. This is without the knowledge of many on the fact that actresses too were swapped for the Gladys Kravitz’s nosey neighbor role. This part was first played by Alice Pearce and later taken by Sandra Gould.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-974 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Darrin-Wasn’t-The-1024x526.jpg\" alt=\"darrin-wasnt-the\" width=\"640\" height=\"329\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Richard Crenna was almost a Darrin</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>As the pilot was searching for Samantha, Richard Sargent was close to signing for the role of Darrin Stephens. He was a young actor in those early days of the show casting. Crenna could have not been a serious consideration but who knows what could have happened to the show if he was chosen! Probably, the Darrin Syndrome would never have occurred.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-975 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Richard-Crenna.png\" alt=\"richard-crenna\" width=\"612\" height=\"415\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Elizabeth Montgomery played multiple roles and never replaced</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>While other characters were being switched, Montgomery never got replaced and in fact, she played as Serena – Samantha’s cousin.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-976 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Elizabeth-Montgomery.jpg\" alt=\"elizabeth-montgomery\" width=\"654\" height=\"495\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Then came Dick Sargent</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>During the 5<sup>th</sup> season of “Bewitched,” York was given some B-12 by a replacement doctor. It was during a lunch break after filming. He got a seizure and was rushed to the hospital. The show continued without Darrin since he never returned. This happened for a few episodes until the new Dick Sargent came in.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-977 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Enter-Dick-Sargent.jpg\" alt=\"enter-dick-sargent\" width=\"547\" height=\"415\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Then Came York</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Later, Richard Crenna got an offer to play the next Darrin, but again he was too busy and tied up with “The Real McCoys”, and so he missed out – again! The male lead role went to Dick York. Later, the role was taken up by Sargent. It is a question of speculation on whether or not the show would have lasted 8 seasons if he took the role.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-978 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/York-It-Is.jpg\" alt=\"york-it-is\" width=\"603\" height=\"452\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Why did Dick York leave?</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>While there was no explanation on the show as to why York departed, the actor had a good reason for his departure. While he was filming <em>Cordura, </em>York tore most of his right back muscles and they never recovered fully. He got pain medication but it was never a long-term solution.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-979 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dick-York’s-Real.png\" alt=\"dick-yorks-real\" width=\"620\" height=\"460\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Elizabeth Montgomery\'s Real Life Pregnancies\r\n</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Elizabeth was pregnant for 3 times. She had her firstborn in July 1964. Two of her pregnancies were brought into the script by the producers. This saw the introduction of Adam and Tabitha to the Stephens family. Indeed, this enriched the TV family in a very natural way.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-980 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Elizabeth-Montgomery-2.png\" alt=\"elizabeth-montgomery-2\" width=\"615\" height=\"421\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>The new Darrin Stephens – Dick York</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Samantha Stephens had a mortal husband, Darrin Stephens. Dick York played his role. Throughout the 60s, he was a beloved actor thanks to this role. In addition, his <em>Inherit the Wind </em>classic film in the 60s gave him a name. He would later carry his charm and looks into his future life.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-981 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dick-York-As-Darrin-1024x723.jpg\" alt=\"dick-york-as-darrin\" width=\"576\" height=\"407\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Anti-Aging Potion</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>In her 60s, Elizabeth was truly a cool babe.

It was set with old-mine diamonds of 8.5 carats. The pin was admired by many including Montgomery. When Moorehead’s TV daughter passed on in 1974, she bequeathed it to her.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-983 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/A-Special-Brooch.jpg\" alt=\"a-special-brooch\" width=\"345\" height=\"504\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Terminal Cancer for Alice Pearce</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Alice Pearce passed away in March 1966; marking has disappearance from the “Bewitched” world. Four months before Alice landed her new role in the show, she got the cancer diagnosis. Unfortunately, even after the surgery, doctors informed her that her ovarian cancer was terminal. She kept this to herself and never told her coworkers about it.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-984 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Alice-Pearce-Cursed-With.png\" alt=\"alice-pearce-cursed-with\" width=\"609\" height=\"447\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>The Emmy Award</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Two months after Alice died, her contribution through her Gladys’ portrayal, she received the Emmy Award for the Outstanding Supporting Actress.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-985 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Emmy-Award-1024x598.jpeg\" alt=\"emmy-award\" width=\"640\" height=\"374\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Friends behind the Camera? Moorehead and York had bloomed one!</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Unlike their uneasy relationship on the show, Darrin and Endora – played by York and Moorehead respectively – were great friends off the camera.

They would bring their own clothes a week prior to filming.

You will be shocked to know that the actress had over 1,000 antique door openers she had collected.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-995 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Aunt-Clara-Actress-1024x955.jpg\" alt=\"aunt-clara-actress\" width=\"613\" height=\"572\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>Samantha’s Magic</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Stagehands had to do an extra thing to deliver Samantha’s “magic.” In the 60s, there was no CGI that existed. For instance, the director would have to yell ‘Cut!’ as Montgomery stood with her arms up whenever Samantha need to tidy the living room up quickly. This would be an opportunity for the stagehand to remove the clutter. Crutch-like devices were used to help her keep her arms up for some time.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-996 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Samantha’s-Magic.jpg\" alt=\"samanthas-magic\" width=\"570\" height=\"594\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>and that Auntie…</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Aunt Clara was known for her endearing to the Stephens, even with all this strangeness.

To imitate the alcohol looks, actors would be advised to use iced tea. For instance, Dick Wilson often played a drunk in Bewitched. He can only be assumed to know the intense acting involved!

Bill Asher and Sol Saks settled for Elizabeth for the series. From the original plans, she was not to make the cut.</h3>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-1022 alignleft\" src=\"http://feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Elizabeth-Montgomery-Almost-Didn’t-1.jpg\" alt=\"elizabeth-montgomery-almost-didnt\" width=\"437\" height=\"566\" /><!--nextpage-->\r\n<h2><strong>…indeed Cassandra was never to be</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>She auditioned for the original role but her contract with Screen Gems tied her down and could never take the job.

The show, “The Partridge Family” debuted before the “Bewitched” series ended its run. This shows that both the Kravitz and the Partridge shared a home.</h3>\r\n<h3>Living in a modern 2-story house that had a white picket fence, the Partridge family was so modern. In 1999, the fence was brought down and the front windows were replaced by bay windows in the “Bewitched” time. The front door was different in a little way. While facing the Partridge house, the next door home to the right was used in the “I Dream of Jeannie” as Jeannie and Major Nelson’s house.

He spent several days in hospital the following year, after concerned friends dialed 999.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Not New to Controversy</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>In October 2006, George was found slumped over the wheel of his car. And in May 2007, he pleaded guilty to driving while unfit through drugs and was banned from driving for two years.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Drug Possession</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>In 2008 Michael took a step back from the public eye but less than a month later he was once again in the glare when he was cautioned for possession of class A drugs, which included crack cocaine, and class C drugs.</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>From Music Star to Gay Hero</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The gay star sold more than 100 million albums with his group and as a solo artist, becoming known for songs like Careless Whisper, Faith, and Last Christmas.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Time in Prison</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>In September 2010 he received an eight-week sentence following an event the previous July in which he crashed his Range Rover into a shop in London. George was also banned from driving for five years after he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of drugs.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>George’s Time in Rehab</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>He sought solace in Australia’s Byron Bay rehab clinic with his then boyfriend Fad Fawaz to deal with emotional anxiety.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Death of his Partner</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael was devastated when his long-term partner Anselmo Feleppa died of a brain haemorrhage in 1993.

He later thanked the doctors who spend three weeks to keep him alive through the media.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hit Star to Gay Hero</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The struggle to establish his true identity took decades for Michael to develop. Publicly, Michael only announced his sexuality after a 1998 incident in a public bathroom in L.A., where he was arrested for “engaging in a lewd act” with a police officer.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael\'s Philanthropy</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Among the charities he quietly aided included Macmillan Cancer Support, Childline, and the London-based HIV-awareness organization Terrence Higgins Trust. According to the Associated Press, Michael donated proceeds from the song \"<em>Jesus to a Child</em>\" to Childline.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael’s Religious Views</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>He was exposed to Protestant Christianity as a school-age youngster in England, but as he describes it, the religion didn’t have much of an impact on him: He praised England for being secular and criticized the United States for being too religious–something he saw as a threat to the gay community.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael’s Rise to Fame</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael, who was set to release a documentary in 2017, rose to fame as a member of Wham!, known for their hits Last Christmas and Club Tropicana.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>His Boyfriend, Fadi Fawaz</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>It is believed that Fadi and George started dating when the gay start split with his long-term partner Kenny Goss in 2009. They have been together for over seven years. It was Fadi who discovered George’s body on 25<sup>th</sup> Decemeber, 2016. It is believed that Fadi will get nothing out of the massive $200 million estate, which is to be divided among George’s godchildren.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>His Early Life</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael aka Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, was born in Bushey, Hertfordshire in 1963 to a Greek Cypriot father and English mother, has sold more than 100m records to date.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael’s Godchildren</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>He had godchildren whom it’s believed that the massive $200+ million estate will be divided among.

He moved to England in the 1950s and changed his name to Jack Panos.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Health Problems</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>On October 2011, He cancelled a performance at London’s Royal Albert Hall due to a viral infection.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael’s Assets</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>He earned close to £48.5 million from his 25 live tours between 2006 and 2008. Sunday Times Rich List 2015 of the wealthiest British musicians estimated his net worth to be £105 million.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Relationships</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>He had a relationship with a Chinese-American make-up artist Kathy Jeung, who appeared in the <em>I Want Your Sex </em>video.

These stars get better looking with age: the older they become, the better they look. Check out the list and see if you agree!</h2>\r\n<h1>Robert Downey Jr.</h1>\r\n<h3>Robert Downey Jr. spent his early Hollywood days in a battle with various drug addictions, which clearly didn\'t help his boyish looks back in the day. Now he is considered one of Hollywood\'s hottest men while being the top-earning actor in the business for the past few years.</h3>\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1421\" src=\"http://www.feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/116.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><!--nextpage--></h3>\r\n<h1>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</h1>\r\n<h3>Moviegoers got their first look of the then-teenager Joseph Gordon-Levitt when he appeared on \"10 Things I Hate About You\" in 1999. Back then he looked like the skinnier, less successful version of his co-star Heath Ledger. Today Joseph has gained some muscle weight, and has grown overall, and looks finer than he did in his early days.</h3>\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1422\" src=\"http://www.feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/215.jpg\" alt=\"2\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><!--nextpage--></h3>\r\n<h1>Dwayne Johnson</h1>\r\n<h3>Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson started his career in wrestling, and wrestlers don\'t necessarily need to be beautiful and presentable. The Rock certainly wasn\'t, as this picture here from his early 20\'s shows. The move to Hollywood did well for old Dwayne, as he is one of the finest looking actors around, with an impeccable style and handsome looks that just keep getting better with time.</h3>\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1423\" src=\"http://www.feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/316.jpg\" alt=\"3\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /> <!--nextpage--></h3>\r\n<h1>Jennifer Lopez</h1>\r\n<h3>Jennifer Lopez has been around for a long, long time.

But recent appearances in films such as \"Horrible Bosses\" (1&amp;2) and \"We\'re The Millers\" prove that her looks just keep getting better with age, even at 47.

For him, age is not only not an issue, but a blessing.</h3>\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1427\" src=\"http://www.feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/74.jpg\" alt=\"7\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /> <!--nextpage--></h3>\r\n<h1>Nicole Kidman</h1>\r\n<h3>The amazingly talented Australian actress Nicole Kidman has been considered a rare and true beauty since her early days.

With a prosperous career spanning over 20 years behind him, it\'s truly a wonder how that man has managed to maintain his good looks and to look even better than he did when he was younger. He\'s been named by People magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful men in the world for three times, and you can obviously understand why.</h3>\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1429\" src=\"http://www.feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/9.png\" alt=\"9\" width=\"549\" height=\"349\" /><!--nextpage--></h3>\r\n<h1>Charlize Theron</h1>\r\n<h3>It truly speaks volumes when you\'re having trouble identifying which picture is from the past and which picture is from the present. Charlize Theron\'s unique, stunning beauty is undeniable, but she manages to look better with each passing year. It\'s mind-boggling to think that these pictures were taken years apart.</h3>\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1430\" src=\"http://www.feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/104.jpg\" alt=\"10\" width=\"551\" height=\"413\" /><!--nextpage--></h3>\r\n<h1>Sean Connery</h1>\r\n<h3>Connery was a gorgeous young man when he played Bond, there\'s absolutely no doubt about that. But even at old age, the Scottish actor looks terrific, showing that for him looks don\'t fade – they improve.</h3>\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1431\" src=\"http://www.feelsyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/117.jpg\" alt=\"11\" width=\"551\" height=\"551\" /><!--nextpage--></h3>\r\n<h1>Ryan Phillippe</h1>\r\n<h3>Ryan Phillippe has been around Hollywood since the 90\'s and has been consistently considered one of the industry\'s biggest heartthrobs. Age doesn\'t seem to affect dear old Ryan as well – on the contrary, he looks just as good today as he did back then.
