She\'s been the blonde, blue-eyed teen queen, the black-haired gothic goddess, the Spanish seductress, and many more. One thing is clear: Aguilera does her own thing, even if there\'s a big media fuss over it. The diva reigns supreme!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1489\" src=\"http://d2o8zujkt7hhe5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/19Christina-Aguilera.jpg\" alt=\"19christina-aguilera\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" />\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage--><strong>John Goodman</strong>\r\n\r\nWow! Would you look at that! There\'s a sharp contrast in the two pictures here. Not only has John Goodman lost a ton of weight, he also looks more sleek and well-put-together in the second picture. Some celebrities are recognizable to us as their fatter version; Goodman included. He first graced our screens as the likable husband Dan on the TV sitcom <em>Roseanne </em>looking much more like the person in the first picture than the second. His skinny self barely looks like the same person, but he looks great!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1475\" src=\"http://d2o8zujkt7hhe5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4John-Goodman.jpg\" alt=\"4john-goodman\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" /><!--nextpage--><strong>Janet Jackson</strong>\r\n\r\nI have to admit, if I was one of the Jackson\'s I\'d probably have issues too. The entire family is a circus of eccentrics, and having a baby brother who goes on to be twenty times more famous that the Jackson Five ever doesn\'t help. Poor Janet tried the music route, but her songs never had the appeal of Michael\'s. It must be difficult to be unmemorable, so it\'s no surprise that the sister-in-the-shadows struggles with her weight. Rest in peace Michael Jackson, the world\'s greatest pop star. Poor, poor Janet.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1519\" src=\"http://d2o8zujkt7hhe5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Janet-Jackson1.jpg\" alt=\"janet-jackson1\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" /><!--nextpage--><strong>Zach Galifianakis</strong>\r\n\r\nNot only does Zach have a surname that\'s impossible to pronounce, he also has a history of being overweight. You can see by the tell-tale belly bulge in the first pic that Zach enjoyed a McDonalds or two. But let\'s be realistic: he wouldn\'t have made us laugh as much in <em>The Hangover</em> without his endearing pudgy face. Sometimes chubby guys make the best comedians. Hopefully he has other job offers though, because now he\'s all handsome and serious looking. He looks more like a drama actor than a comedy one now, but at least his health is all the better for it!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1488\" src=\"http://d2o8zujkt7hhe5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18Zach-Galifianakis.jpg\" alt=\"18zach-galifianakis\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" /><!--nextpage--><strong>Lauren Alaina</strong>\r\n\r\nLauren stunned us on <em>American Idol</em> with her sultry country voice.
